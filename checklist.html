                        <h1>Nail Salon Cancellation Policy</h1>
                        <p>At The Modern Manicure Co., we understand that sometimes unexpected circumstances arise, and you may need to cancel or reschedule your appointment. Please provide us with ample notice to accommodate other clients waiting for an appointment slot. Please review our cancellation policy below:</p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Appointment Deposit:</strong>When booking an appointment, we require a 50% deposit of your total appointment cost. This will be taken off of your bill when you attend your appointment. If you cancel your appointment within 24 hours', this deposit is non-refundable.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Cancellation Notice:</strong> We require at least 24 hours' notice for all cancellations or rescheduling requests. This allows us the opportunity to offer the appointment slot to another client.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>2. Late Cancellations/No-Shows:</strong> Cancellations made less than 24 hours before the scheduled appointment time, or failure to show up for the appointment without prior notice, will result in a cancellation fee equivalent to [insert fee amount or percentage].
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>3. Rescheduling:</strong> Clients may reschedule appointments without incurring a cancellation fee if the request is made at least 24 hours before the scheduled appointment time, and the new appointment is within a reasonable timeframe.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Emergency Situations:</strong> We understand that emergencies happen. If you have a sudden emergency and cannot make your appointment, please contact us as soon as possible to discuss your situation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Repeat Offenses:</strong> Clients who habitually cancel appointments without adequate notice or fail to show up for scheduled appointments may be required to prepay for future services or may risk being unable to schedule appointments with us in the future.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Appointment Confirmation:</strong> We may reach out to confirm your appointment via phone call, email, or text message. It is your responsibility to confirm or reschedule your appointment if needed.
                        </p>
